# Applied Machine Learning in Python

This is the third course of the 'Applied Data Science with Python' Specialization by Michigan University in Coursera. 

# Project: 
## Understanding Property Maintenance Fines from MDST Blight Data

This assignment is based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](http://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)). The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (MSSISS) have partnered with the City of Detroit to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing Detroit - blight. Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?

All data for this assignment has been provided through the [Detroit Open Data Portal](https://data.detroitmi.gov/).

Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling using Gradient boosting has been done using python.
